# Aiken Crowdfund

To ideate, design and develop an open source smart contract who enables ADA holders to collaboratively fund the deposit required to submit a governance action on Cardano onchain governance. The goal is to allow trustless crowdfunding and exact refunds while respecting the rules of on-chain governance (CIP-1694 & Constitution). 

Ultimately removing financial barriers for Cardano citizens who want to engage in Onchain Governance by submitting Governance Actions
